You decide to log into the NET. Celci, Sam, and the crew are all there. Some of them look pleased to see you, and some look quite upset. Sam approaches you. “Hey, where have you BEEN!?” She gasps dramatically. “It’s rude to not come in and see your favorite girl! I’ve been messing with your phone for the last TWO DAYS to get your attention and you’re only now coming to see me? I’m hurt!”

 * [FLATTER (skill check) - (you tell her you’ve been working to get money to buy a new pretty case) +2 Aff]
 (FAILED: -2 Aff) You fumble over your words, and you end up telling Sam you've been working to get money to upgrade Lotte. Oof.
 
 * [BE HONEST - (you tell her you’re a bit worried about school) +1 Aff]
 (SUCCESS: +1 Aff) She's still sad but she understands, and asks you to just be honest with her in the future.
 
 * [SHRUG OFF - (you tell her you don’t need to be spending a lot of time on your phone) - 2 Aff]
 She's angered by this response as she sees how much time you spend with your other tech. Maybe this wasn't a good thing to say to her...
